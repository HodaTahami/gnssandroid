## Aided GNSS in Challenging Environments

> **“GPS is the most widely used positioning technology for Location Based Services (LBS) used outdoors. However, GPS signals cannot be applied to indoor applications where they are blocked. This is commonly happening also in dense urban canyons so that the users may need to use other technologies, e.g., based on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile networks. However, these techniques do not yet provide a globally available, free of charge, privacy-preserving, accurate, and stand-alone positioning service like GPS does in outdoors.  On release of Android Nougat, mobile devices, i.e. tablets and mobile phones, running the Android 7 and higher operating systems could generate the actual GPS measurements. Previously, only the GPS coordinates (as lat/long/height or x/y/z) can be provided. The availability of raw GPS data allows the accumulation of the raw GPS observations, captured over a longer period or from another close enough location to compute the user’s position in harsh environments such as indoors and urban canyons, where not enough number of satellites is in view ”.**
